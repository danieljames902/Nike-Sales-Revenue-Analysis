Nike US Sales Revenue Analysis: Presentation Summary (Tuned Random Forest Model with Additional Features)
==================================================

Objective:
- Identify key factors influencing Sales Revenue using Random Forest regression.

Dataset Overview:
- Source: Nike_US_Sales.xlsx
- Features: Units Sold, Operating Profit, Retailer ID, Quarter, Sales Method, Product Category (subcategories: Running, Basketball, Lifestyle, Soccer, Training, Other), Sales_Method_Product_Category interaction, Region (Midwest, Northeast, Southeast, West)
- Target: Sales Revenue (derived as Operating Profit / Operating Margin)

Key Findings:
- Units Sold and Operating Profit are the strongest predictors of Sales Revenue (highest feature importance).
- Retailer ID, Quarter, Sales Method, and Product Category contribute to predictions.
- Sales Method: Online sales have higher typical revenue, suggesting a focus on e-commerce strategies.
- Product Category: Basketball and Lifestyle shoes may drive higher revenue (check feature importance).
- Interaction term (Sales_Method_Product_Category): Captures combined effects (e.g., Online Basketball sales).
- Region: West (Retailer ID_1128299) and Northeast (Retailer ID_1185732) may have higher sales; Southeast (Retailer ID_1197831) underperforms.
- Seasonal trends: Retailer ID_1189833 (Midwest) peaks in Q2 but drops in Q4; Retailer ID_1197831 (Southeast) underperforms across quarters.
- Outliers capped at 99th percentile, reducing their impact on predictions.

Model Performance (Tuned Random Forest):
- Testing R-squared: 0.9840
- Testing RMSE: 18000.59
- Testing MAE: 7806.61
- Cross-Validation R-squared Mean: 0.9755, Std: 0.0030
- Comparison to Huber Regression (Improved Model):
- Huber R-squared: 0.9206, RMSE: 21,808.14, MAE: 8,625.77, Cross-Validation Std: 0.9628

Recommendations:
- Focus on increasing Units Sold to boost Sales Revenue.
- Leverage seasonal trends: Target Q4 and Q3 for marketing campaigns; support Retailer ID_1189833 (Midwest) in Q4 to address its sales drop.
- Investigate Retailer ID_1197831’s underperformance in Southeast: Check sales method, product category mix, and regional factors.
- Monitor Retailer ID_1128299 (West) for consistent performance as a benchmark.
- Optimize sales channels: Boost Online sales to capitalize on higher revenue potential.
- Tailor strategies by Product Category: Promote high-revenue categories like Basketball shoes.
- Regional Strategy: Focus on high-performing regions like West and Northeast; support Southeast to improve sales.
- Use Sales_Method_Product_Category insights for targeted campaigns (e.g., Online Basketball shoe promotions in West).

Limitations:
- Dataset contains only footwear; broader product types (e.g., apparel) could enhance Product Category insights.
- Region inferred from Retailer ID; actual geographic data could improve accuracy.
- Cross-validation variability (check Std) may indicate remaining data heterogeneity.
